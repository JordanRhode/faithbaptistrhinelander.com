        	<h3>Faith Baptist Church is Independent and Non-Denominational</h3>
  <p>A local New Testament church is self-governed, and autonomous. We appeal to
  no other person but Jesus Christ who is the author and finisher of our faith.
  (Heb. 12:2)</p>
  <h3>Faith Baptist Church Adheres to Biblical Fundamentals</h3>
  <p>We hold to the basic core of Biblical doctrines for faith and practice and separate from false teaching. (Jude 3)
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Inspiration and authority of Scripture:</strong> God authored all of Scripture, every word of it and every part of it. (2Timothy 3:16). The Bible is God's Truth (John 17:17). It is without doctrinal error!
    <li><strong>The Deity of Jesus Christ:</strong> He is fully God as well as fully Man. He has always existed as God, and He always will be God. (John 1:1; 20:31; 1 Timothy 3:16).
    <li><strong>Christ's Virgin Birth and Miracles:</strong> Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:18-25) and was sinless (Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22). He performed miracles to authenticate His credentials as Israel's Messiah (John 20:30,31).
    <li><strong>Christ's Blood Atonement for Sin:</strong> Jesus shed His blood as the payment for our sin. Without the shedding of His blood, there would be no remission of sin (Romans 3:24-26; Colossians 1:13-14; Hebrews 9:14-28; Revelation 1:5).
    <li><strong>Christ's Bodily Resurrection:</strong> Jesus arose from the grave, triumphing over death and assuring believers of their future resurrection (Luke 24:1-12, 34-38; 1 Corinthians 15:1-20).
    <li><strong>Christ's Personal Return:</strong> Jesus assured His disciples that he will come again (John 14:1-3). Angels announced His return (Acts 1:11), and the apostles taught that He will return (1 Thessalonians 4:13-17; Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 3:1-10; 1 John 3:2).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Faith Baptist Church is Baptist</h3>
  <p>A church's distinctive beliefs set it apart from all others. A Baptist
  church in general, holds to convictions that make them different from all
  other groups. Historically, Baptist churches have continued to hold to the
  Baptist distinctives because these distinctives are Biblical. These teachings
  may be remembered by associating them with the letters that form the word
  &quot;BAPTISTS.&quot; The historical Baptist position centers on these
  Biblical distinctives:</p>
  <p class="dist"><strong>Biblical Authority</strong> — Bible is the final
  authority in all matters of belief and practice because the Bible is inspired
  by God and bears the absolute authority of God Himself. Whatever the Bible
  affirms, Baptists accept as true. No human opinion or decree of any church
  group can override the Bible. Creeds and confessions of faith attempt to
  articulate the theology of Scripture, but do not carry Scripture's inherent
  authority.</p>
  <p class="ref">Timothy 3:15-17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:20, 21</p>
  <p class="dist"><strong>Autonomy of the Local Church</strong> — local church
  is an independent body accountable to the Lord Jesus Christ, the head of the
  church. All human authority for governing the local church resides within the
  local church itself. Thus the church is autonomous, or self-governing
  congregationally ruled Church. No religious hierarchy outside the local church
  may dictate a church's beliefs or practices. Autonomy does not mean isolation.
  A Baptist church may fellowship with other churches around mutual interests
  and in an associational tie, but a Baptist church cannot be a
  &quot;member&quot; of any other body.</p>
  <p class="ref">Colossians 1:18; 2 Corinthians 8:1-5, 19, 23</p>
  <p class="dist"><strong>Priesthood of the Believer</strong> —
  &quot;Priest&quot; is defined as &quot;one authorized to perform the sacred
  rites of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and
  God.&quot; Every believer today is a priest of God and may enter into His
  presence in prayer directly through our Great High Priest, Jesus Christ. No
  other mediator is needed between God and people. As priests, we can study
  God's Word, pray for others, and offer spiritual worship to God. We all have
  equal access to God—whether we are a preacher or not.</p>
  <p class="ref">I Peter 2:5, 9; Revelation 5:9, 10</p>
  <p class="dist"><strong>Two Ordinances</strong> — The local church should
  practice two ordinances: (1) baptism of believers by immersion in water,
  identifying the individual with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection,
  and (2) the Lord's Supper, or communion, commemorating His death for our sins.
  Thus, believers only practice Communion during the Lord's Supper.</p>
  <p class="ref">Matthew 28:19, 20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-32</p>
  <p class="dist" ><strong>Individual Soul Liberty</strong>
  — Every individual, whether a believer or an unbeliever, has the liberty to
  choose what he believes is right in the religious realm. No one should be
  forced to assent to any belief against his will. Baptists have always opposed
  religious persecution. However, this liberty does not exempt one from
  responsibility to the Word of God or from accountability to God Himself.
  However, soul liberty challenges believers to morally and ethically separate
  from the activity of an unregenerate person.</p>
  <p class="ref">Romans 14:5, 12; 2 Corinthians 4:2; Titus 1:9</p>
  <p class="dist"><strong>Saved, Baptized Church Membership</strong> — Local
  church membership is restricted to individuals who give a believable testimony
  of personal faith in Christ and have publicly identified themselves with Him
  in believer's baptism. When the members of a local church are believers,
  oneness in Christ exists, and the members can endeavor to keep the unity of
  the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
  <p class="ref">Acts 2:41-47; 1 Corinthians 12:12; 2 Corinthians 6:14;
  Ephesians 4:3</p>
  <p class="dist"><strong>Two Offices</strong> — The Bible mandates only two
  offices in the church—pastor and deacon. The three terms for
  &quot;pastor,&quot; &quot;elder,&quot; and &quot;bishop,&quot; or
  &quot;overseer&quot;—all refer to the same office. The two offices of pastor
  and deacon exist within the local church, not as a hierarchy outside or over
  the local church.</p>
  <p class="ref">1 Timothy 3:1-13; Acts 20:17-38; Philippians 1:1</p>
  <p class="dist"><strong>Separation of Church and State</strong> — God
  established both the church and the civil government, and He gave each its own
  distinct sphere of operation. The government's purposes are outlined in Romans
  13:1-7 and the church's purposes in Matthew 28:19 and 20. Neither should
  control the other, nor should there be an alliance between the two. Christians
  in a free society can properly influence government toward righteousness,
  which is not the same as a denomination or group of churches controlling the
  government. The Government exists for the common good and is an agent of God.</p>
