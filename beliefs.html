                <h3>The Holy Scriptures</h3>
                <p>We believe that the Bible, consisting of a
                total of sixty-six books in the Old and New Testaments, is without error
                in the original manuscripts. (Prov. 30:5-6, John 17:17) The author of the
                Bible was God the Holy Spirit (II Pet. 1:19-21, Heb. 1:1-2) who guided the
                human authors without distorting their person or character (II Sam. 23:2
                with Acts 1:16, II Thess. 3:17) so that the writings they produced were
                verbally and plenarily inspired. (Matt. 5:18, John 10:35, II Tim. 3:16) We
                believe that the Bible is the sole authority for faith and practice. (Acts
                17:11, I Corinthians 10:6-12, Eph. 6:17, II Tim 3:15-17, I John 4:1)</p>

            	<h3>The True God</h3>
                <p>We believe that there is only one living and true God  (Deut. 6:4-5, Jer. 10:10) who is an eternal, self-existing, perfect Spirit. (Hab. 1:12, John 4:24, James 1:17)  He is a personal Being and the Creator and Upholder of the universe. (Gen. 1:1-25, Heb. 1:10, Col. 1:15-17)  Though, one God He exists in three Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. ( Matt. 3:16, 28:19, II Cor. 13:14) These Persons are equal in essence and in every divine perfection, (John 10:30, 14:10, 17:5, I Cor. 8:6, Phil. 2:5-6) but each has His own distinct work to perform. (John 14:26, 15:26, Eph. 1:3-4, 6-7, 13-14)</p>

            	<h3>Creation</h3>
                <p>We believe that the Genesis account of creation is to be accepted literally and not figuratively.  (Gen. 1:1-2:25, Neh. 9:6, Psalm 33:6-9, John 1:3, Heb. 11:3,Col. 1:16-17). We believe that the six days of creation mentioned in Genesis chapter one were solar hour days. (Gen.1:17-18, Ex. 20:11) We believe that all animal and vegetable life was made directly and they follow God’s law in multiplying “after their kind.” (Gen. 1:11,12, 21,24-25)  We believe that the entire human race sprang from one man, Adam, and one woman, Eve, literal people, who were created directly in God’s image and after His likeness and did not evolve from any lower form of life. 
(Gen. 1:26-27; 5:2)</p>

            	<h3>The Fall of Man</h3>
                <p>We believe that man was originally created a sinless being. (Gen. 1:27, 31, 2:16-17, Eccles. 7:29)  By voluntary transgression he fell from that sinless state, (Gen. 3:6-7, Rom. 5:12,19) and as a result, all mankind are now sinners by nature and by conduct (Ps. 51:5, Is 53:6, Rom. 3:9-18, 23, 5:15-19,  James 2:10) and are justly under divine condemnation. (John 3:36, Rom. 1:18-20)</p>

            <section id="4" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>The Lord Jesus Christ</h3>
                <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God (Heb. 1:1-2, Psalms 2) who is today both truly God and truly man. (John 10:30, Phil 2:5-8) His literal human body was miraculously conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit, and He was born of a human mother who was a virgin. (Is. 7:14, Luke 1:26-38)  At conception He became the God-Man with two natures, divine and human. (John 1:1-2, John 8:58, Phil, 2:7-8)  After His birth He lived a sinless life on earth, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners by bearing the judgment of their sins,  was raised bodily from the tomb as a testimony to the sufficiency of His sacrifice and is a guarantee of His people’s future resurrection.  (Luke 24:1-6, I Pet. 2:21-24,  I Cor. 15:1-7, 23-26)  He now is in heaven as the great High Priest of His people.  (Heb. 4:14)  He will return for His people at the Rapture of the church, and later to the earth to reign following the tribulation period. (Matt. 24:30-31, I Cor. 15:51-52.)</p>
            </section>
            <section id="5" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
                <p>We believe that the Holy Spirit is an eternal and divine Person, co-equal with God the Father and God the Son. (II Cor. 13:14 )  He was active in creation. (Gen. 1:1-2)  He convicts men of sin. (John 16:8-11)  He indwells each believer. (I Cor. 6:19-20)  He performs various ministries such as regenerating, sealing, guiding, teaching, sanctifying and strengthening. (John 3:3, Romans 8:14, Eph. 1:13, 17, 3:16)<br/><br/>
                Each believer has been sanctified positionally in Christ, is being sanctified by the continuing work of the Spirit, and ultimately at Christ’s coming will be completely sanctified. (I Cor. 1:2, 12:4-7, 11, II Cor. 3:18)  While the believer can have victory over sin through the power of the Spirit, his sin nature will not be eradicated in this life. (Rom. 7:18-25, I John 1:8)<br/><br/>
                The Holy Spirit bestows spiritual gifts upon every believer, these gifts are special abilities for service.  Some gifts such as tongues, prophesy and healing, were temporary sign or revelatory gifts and have ceased. (II Cor. 12:12 with Eph. 2:19-22, Heb. 2:4, I Cor. 13:8)<br/><br/>
                It is the believer’s privilege to be filled with the Spirit and follow the Scriptures, thus producing fruit unto God, and to live a joyous and productive Christian life. (Eph. 5:18, Gal. 5:22-23)</p>
            </section>
            <section id="6" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>Salvation</h3>
                <p>Salvation is made free to all by the gospel. (Rom. 3:24, I Tim. 2:4, 4:10)  It is initiated by God, and is accomplished by grace apart from any human works. (Eph. 2:8-9)  It is the duty of all persons to accept it by personal faith. (John 3:16, Acts 16:31)  All who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ are forgiven, regenerated, and justified. (Romans 5:1, Eph. 1:7, I Pet. 1:23)  They are given spiritual life which is manifested in their growth in grace. (II Pet. 3:18)  True believers are saved forever and can never be lost. (John 10:27-30, Romans 8:1) </p>
            </section>
            <section id="7" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>Personal Godliness</h3>
                <p>We believe that the result of being filled with the Spirit is a life of personal godliness.  (Titus 1:1, 2:11-12)  The believer is to use wisdom in the world and repudiate sinful patterns of life and thought, (I John 2:15-17, James 4:4) and to present himself as a living sacrifice to God. (Romans 12:1-2)  Christians must guard against the notion that holiness is produced by obedience to rules and regulations, as well as the concept that life under grace permits us to indulge in the sins of the flesh.  Life under grace does not allow the believer to live as he wishes. (Romans 6:1-2, 12-13, Titus 2:11-14)  He is under a divine mandate to be Holy. (I Peter 1:16)  The teaching of Scripture regarding the Christian life is not merely positive in nature, but is also negative, warning the believer against sin.  A fruitful Christian life is produced through daily fellowship with the Lord and the control of the Holy Spirit. (Galatians 5:16-24)</p>
            </section>
            <section id="8" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>The Church</h3>
                <p>We believe that the church, the Body of Christ, is composed of all true believers who are placed into that Body by the baptizing work of the Holy Spirit.  (Matt. 16:18, I Cor. 12:13, Eph. 1:22-23)  The church is distinct from Israel. (Eph. 3:3-6)<br/><br/>
We believe that a local, visible church is an organized congregation of immersed believers, (Acts 2:41-42) associated together by a common faith and fellowship in the Gospel.  Such a church is to be governed by the Word of God,  (II Tim 3:16-17)  and to observe the ordinances of baptism (the immersion of true believers only) and the Lord’s table. (Matt. 28:19-20, I  Cor. 11:23-24) It’s scriptural officers are male believers referred to in Scripture as bishops and deacons.  The qualifications of the church officers are defined in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus. (I Tim. 3:1-16, Titus 1:5-9)<br/>  <br/>
A local church is autonomous, is not to be subject to the control of any outside persons or organizations, and has the power and right to confess its own faith and conduct its own affairs in accordance with the teachings of the New Testament.  On all matters of membership, polity, government, discipline, and benevolence the will of the local church is final. (Matt. 18:15-18, Acts 6:3-5, I Cor. 5:4-5, 13, I Tim. 3:15)  <br/><br/>
We believe that both Christian baptism and the Lord’s Supper are each a symbolic memorial and a proclamation of our faith. (Romans 6:3-4, I Cor. 11:26)  We believe that Christian baptism is immersion in water of a believer, (Acts 8:36-39) in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. (Matt. 28:19)  It shows forth, in a solemn and beautiful figure, our faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Savior, and our death to sin and resurrection to a new life. (Romans 6:3-4)  Baptism is prerequisite to the privileges of church membership.  (Acts 2:41-42, Matt. 28:19-20)  At the Lord’s Supper, the members of the Church, by the use of bread and the fruit of the vine, commemorate together the death, resurrection, and second coming of Christ. (I Cor. 11:26)  This commemoration should always be preceded by careful self-examination. (I Cor. 11:28)<br/><br/>
The church and its members should have as primary goals the evangelization of their own area, the extension of the gospel to the ends of the earth through Biblical missionary methods, and the edification of believers. (Acts 8:4, 11:20-21)</p>
            </section>
            <section id="9" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>Angels</h3>
                <p>We believe in the existence of angels who are mighty spiritual beings that were created by God.  They serve Him in various ways and are specially appointed to watch over and minister to God’s people.  (Heb. 1:6, 14)  <br/><br/>
We believe that at some time in the past a large number of angels, under the leadership of him who is called Satan, rebelled against God and were removed from His presence. (Rev. 12:4, Matt. 25:41)  They now roam the universe and are especially active on earth, opposing God and His purposes and ruling over the spiritual darkness of this world. (I Tim. 4:1, Eph. 6:12)  Satan, also called the Devil, is a real personality who has tremendous power and is the enemy of God’s people.  He is destined to be judged by Christ at His return, and finally to be eternally incarcerated in the lake of fire. (Rev. 20:1-3, 10)</p>
            </section>
            <section id="10" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>Theological Error</h3>
                <p>We believe that the Word of God predicts widespread departure from the revealed Word of God as the time of Christ’s coming draws nearer, (I Tim 4:1-3, II Pet. 2:1-3, I Jn 4:1)<br/><br/>
And that obedient believers and local churches are to practice complete separation from those who deny faith in Jesus Christ and the Scriptures.  The Scripture teaches that we are not to seek to win them back to the faith by fellowshipping with them, but rather we are to identify them, rebuke them, and withdraw ourselves from any spiritual communion with them. (Ps. 1:1, Rom. 16:17, II Cor. 6:17, Jude 1-4, Titus 1:13)<br/><br/>
We also believe that we are to refuse ecclesiastical fellowship and organizational cooperation with those who are truly born again, but who espouse doctrines that are contrary to Scripture or are engaged in practices that are not consistent with the Word of God. (Gal. 2:11-21, II Thes. 3:6-12, II Peter 3:15-17)</p>
            </section>
            <section id="11" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>Civil Government</h3>
                <p>We believe that civil government is of divine appointment and is for the maintenance of good order in human society.  (Rom. 13:1-7)  Believers are to pray for, honor and obey civil authorities (Tit. 3:1, I Pet. 2:13-14, I Tim. 2:1-3) except where to do so would be to violate plain commands and principles of the Word of God. (Acts 4:18-20, 5:29)  The Church and the State have separate spheres of authority and the state has no valid jurisdiction over the ministry of the Church. (Matt. 22:21)  The state should not favor one ecclesiastical group over another nor should the state impose taxes for the support of any form of religion.  A free church in a free state is the Scriptural ideal.</p>

            	<h3>The Lord's Day</h3>
                <p>We believe that the first day of the week is the Lord’s Day, and is a Christian institution that is to be kept sacred to spiritual purposes insofar as is possible on the part of the individual believer.  It commemorates the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead.  (John 20:1, 19)  It is a time for public worship and for spiritual growth. (Acts 20:7, I Cor.16:1-2)</p>
            </section>
            <section id="13" class="beliefs">
            	<h3>Future Events</h3>
                <p>We believe that there is a radical and essential difference between the righteous and the wicked.  Those who are righteous will enter into eternal bliss with Christ and those who are wicked will be lost forever. (Mal.3:18, John 3:16-18)  <br/><br/>
We believe that the Scriptures teach that at death the spirit/soul of the believer pass into the presence of Christ and remain in conscious joy until the resurrection of the body when Christ comes for His own.  (I Cor. 15:51-57, II Cor. 5:8)  The blessed hope of the believer is the imminent, personal, pretribulational, premillennial appearance of Christ to rapture the Church, His bride, prior to the seventieth week of Daniel. (I Thess. 4:13-18, Titus 2:13)  God’s righteous judgments will then be poured out upon an unbelieving world during the seven years of tribulation.  (Rev. 6:17)  The climax of this fearful era will be the physical return of Jesus Christ to the earth in great glory to reestablish the Davidic kingdom.  (Rev. 19:11-20:6)  Israel will be saved and restored as a nation. (Rom. 11:26-27)  Satan will be bound and the curse essentially will be lifted from the physical creation. ( Is. 35:1-7)  Following this thousand year reign of Christ (the Millennium), the Great White Throne judgment will occur, at which time the bodies and souls of the wicked shall be reunited and cast into the lake of fire, a divinely-appointed place of eternal torment. (Rev. 20:7-15)  The saved will enter into the city which God has prepared for His own and will live with the Lord in resurrected and glorified bodies forever.  (Phil. 3:20-21, Rev. 21:1-3)</p>
