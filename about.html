        	<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Faith Baptist Church</span> of Rhinelander is the culmination of years of prayers for a new Church in city of Rhinelander. The Lord graciously brought the leadership of both Northland International University of Dunbar, WI and Faith Baptist Church of Pembine, WI in contact with local families desirous of a church that would be faithful to Jesus Christ and His word. They began a Bible study in the home of Mike and Mary Rhode in January of 2004, and moved to the Claridge Motor Inn during the Easter season of that year. A core group of people were then committed to forming a new Church in Rhinelander.<br/><br/> In August of 2004, Mark Ring, a graduate of Maranatha Baptist Bible College in Watertown, WI, and Central Baptist Theological Seminary in Virginia Beach, VA, moved his family to Rhinelander to assist this group of believers with their goal.<br/><br/>
  During the fall of 2004, Northland sent an extension team of students on Thursday evenings to help with youth group and children's ministries. The group outgrew the motel conference room and moved to the Oneida County Senior Citizen Center. It was during this period that the name "Faith Baptist Church" was adopted.<br/><br/>
  Early in 2005 a substantial financial gift to the church made it possible to lease commercial space in downtown Rhinelander on a temporary basis for three months. A logo was created and the church began advertising their location. The first Sunday service was held on March 13, 2005 with 36 people attending. The church steadily grew and chartered on June 26, 2005. Faith Baptist Church met at 91 Courtney Street until June 25, 2006.<br/><br/>
  On July 2, 2006, Faith Baptist Church moved to its present location at 23 East Timber Drive. This is the former location of First Baptist Church, which voted to dissolve their organization and donate their property to Faith Baptist Church. We are grateful to God for His leading in giving us this tool and for the former members of First Baptist for their gracious gift.<br/><br/>
  Faith Baptist Church of Rhinelander has adopted as its slogan; "Magnifying Jesus Christ in Northcentral Wisconsin." We invite you to be a vital part of what God is doing here in our city for His glory and our good.
